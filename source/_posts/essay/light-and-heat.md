我努力地呼吸
I try hard to breathe
仍然覺得氧氣不夠
Maybe the oxygen is too thin and
肺部仿佛被什麼東西重重壓著
Something heavy presses my lung
快要令我窒息
Which make me suffocating

我努力地呼吸
I try hard to breathe
想到兒時的烏婆嶺
Think of the Oubo hill
那兒風吹樹葉陽光正好
Where the wind brows the leaves, the sunshine is perfect
我跑步去到那裡
And I go running

何等光彩奪目
How dazzling the sunshine is
我關掉了空調
I turn off the air-conditioner 
推開窗
And push the window
感受光和熱
Feel the light and heat
